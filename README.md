**Candy Machine UI Setup Guide**

**Overview:**
This guide offers detailed instructions for establishing the user interface (UI) for your Candy Machine, streamlining the NFT minting process using the SPL token you've generated. Payment for minted NFTs will be processed through the SPL token, and users can seamlessly mint NFTs by linking their Phantom wallets.

**Prerequisites:**
Ensure you have the following:

1. A configured Candy Machine with specific details in its config.json file, including pricing, quantity, symbol, seller fee, SPL token account, SPL token, go-live date, and creator details.
2. A designated Phantom wallet for minting.

**Steps:**

1. **Set Up the SPL Token:**
   If not done already, create the SPL token as per the guidelines in Lesson Three, and make a note of its address.

2. **Update Candy Machine Config:**
   Modify your Candy Machine's config.json file:
   - Update `splTokenAccount` with the created SPL token account address.
   - Update `splToken` with the SPL token address.

3. **Set Up the UI:**
   Refer to the "Quick Node: Set Up a Minting Site" tutorial to create a user-friendly interface for your Candy Machine. This UI allows users to connect their Phantom wallets and mint NFTs, utilizing the SPL token for payment.

4. **Modify Minting Logic:**
   In your SPL project's minting logic (as per Lesson Three), adjust it to mint NFTs to the Phantom wallet address or modify the transfer function to deliver minted NFTs to your Phantom wallet.

5. **Testing:**
   Thoroughly test your setup by transferring or minting your SPL token to a Phantom account. Utilize the created UI to mint NFTs; users should successfully mint NFTs by paying with the designated SPL token.
